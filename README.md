# Akeeba Portable Tools - DISCONTINUED

Akeeba Backup and Akeeba Solo desktop tools. NO LONGER MAINTAINED.

This repository contains what used to be the desktop utilities which were meant to be used with Akeeba Backup / Akeeba Solo to make your life easier. All of these tools were rewritten in C#, targetting .NET Framework 4.5 / Mono 4.5. Graphical interfaces were built using WindowsForms for maximum cross-platform interoperability.

## DISCONTINUED NOVEMBER 2018

Unfortunately, people seem to find it hard to read the requirements in the download page and install Mono, linked to from that page. Trying to educate them seems hopeless. Instead of following the simple instructions (download this, install it, done) they start debating the choice of programming language and other trivialities â€“ yet they are unwilling to contribute anything beyond sheer negativity. In the end of the day this hinders me from developing the software that matters. I have no choice but to discontinue this fringe product that offers zero benefit to me and my company.

PS: Use Akeeba Kickstart. It's written in PHP. It works in a browser (browsers ARE cross platform!) and the CLI. How you set up a local web server or PHP is up to you; I can't and won't help you with that.
